      <h2>Set Smart Limits</h2>
      <p>
        Take charge. Children crave limits, which help them understand and manage an often confusing world. Show your love by setting boundaries so your kids can explore and discover their passions safely.
        
        Don't clip your child's wings. Your toddler's mission in life is to gain independence. So when they're developmentally capable of putting their toys away, clearing their plate from the table, and dressing themselves, let them. Giving a child responsibility is good for their self-esteem (and your sanity!).
        
        Don't try to fix everything. Give young kids a chance to find their own solutions. When you lovingly acknowledge a child's minor frustrations without immediately rushing in to save them, you teach them self-reliance and resilience.
        
        Remember that discipline is not punishment. Enforcing limits is really about teaching kids how to behave in the world and helping them to become competent, caring, and in control.
        
        Pick your battles. Kids can't absorb too many rules without turning off and tuning out. Forget arguing about little stuff like fashion choices and occasional potty language. Focus on the things that really matter like no hitting, rude talk, or lying.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="section2" class="container">
      <h2>Create Your Quality Time</h2>
      <p>Play with your children. Let them choose the activity, and don't worry about rules. Just go with the flow and have fun. That's the name of the game.

        Read books together every day. Get started when they're a newborn; babies love listening to the sound of their parents' voices. Cuddling up with your child and a book is a great bonding experience that will set them up for a lifetime of reading.
        
        Schedule daily special time. Let your child choose an activity where you hang out together for 10 or 15 minutes with no interruptions. There's no better way for you to show your love.
        
        Encourage family time. The greatest untapped resource available for improving the lives of our children is time with their parents. Kids with engaged parents do better in school, problem-solve more successfully, and generally cope better with whatever life throws at them.
        
        Make warm memories. Your children will probably not remember anything that you say to them, but they will recall the family rituals—like bedtimes and game night—that you do together.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="section3" class="container">
      <h2>Be A Good Role Model</h2>
      <p>Be the role model your children deserve. Kids learn by watching their parents. Modeling appropriate, respectful, good behavior works much better than telling them what to do.

        Fess up when you blow it. This is the best way to show your child how and when they should apologize.
        
        Live a little greener. Show your kids how easy it is to care for the environment. Waste less, recycle, reuse, and conserve each day. Spend an afternoon picking up trash around the neighborhood.
        
        Always tell the truth. It's how you want your child to behave, right?
        
        Kiss and hug your partner in front of the kids. Your partnership is one example your child has of what an intimate relationship looks, feels, and sounds like. So it's important to set a great standard.
        
        Respect parenting differences. Support your co-parent's basic approach to raising kids—unless it's way out of line. Criticizing or arguing with your partner will do more harm to your relationship and your child's sense of security than if you accept standards that are different from your own.</p>
